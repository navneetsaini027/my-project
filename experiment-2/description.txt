In this Experiment I created a Bank deposit and Withdraw UI by using HTML and Basic CSS.

HTML :

To make this I use the different Tags of HTML like div , button .
In order to apply diffrent css to different Div a class attribute is intialised inside that Tag

Basic Structure:(Experiment-2)

An outer_div which hold all the content inside it  An inner_div which holds the content like deposit and withdraw buttons also withdraw amount.

By this HTML skeleton is Ready now we have to apply CSS to it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS :

It stands for cascading style sheets which used to add design and color to the HTML code.

Types:

Inline css : write CSS inside the specific TAg.
Internal CSS : A Style tag include in the HTML file which defines which style to which tag.
External CSS : Instead of writing CSS code to the HTML file , A Separated file is created  in that folder
                and then the path of that file is include in the HTML file by using LINK tag. 

Basic Structure of CSS :

Selector {                      i.e  body{
    Property : value ;                 background-color : yellow;
        }                                  }

CSS properties used in this experiment :

BOX model :
This is basic model of css which help to identify what is padding ,margin , border and content.

Padding : Space between the border and Content.
Margin : The space between two containers.

Design Flex :

This is basically a Layout which help to organize the Content is Row and column .
if Flex- direction is Row then row wise content wil display and similar for column.

Responsiveness :

Responsive UI basicaly a UI which adjust itself according to screen ratio .
For this we use @media selector which have some parameter on to which the UI become Responsive.

Some of the basic CSS Properties Used :

background-color         // to set bg color .
color                    // to set color of fonts.
justify-content          // to justify the cotent .
border                   // to edit the border of the container.
border-radius            // to smooth the edges of the containers
display                  // which type of layout are we using.
